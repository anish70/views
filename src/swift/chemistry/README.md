Some English words can be spelled as concatenations of chemical
element symbols (disregarding capitalization). For example,
*incarcerations* can be written as `INCArCeRaTiONS` (iodine, nitrogen,
carbon, argon, cerium, radium, titanium, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur).

Design an algorithm to find the longest word spellable in this way.
