In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
or (often, in modern usage):
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ... (We are using this series in this exercise)

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation

F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}

with seed values:

F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1

fibonacci.c is an attempt to print the first n numbers (input value) in the sequence, using recursion.

Can we make it work!
